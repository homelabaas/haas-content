# HaaS - Sample content

This is sample content you can upload to your minio server, to get started with the HaaS product. When you install HaaS from scratch you will get the option to load these files in automatically, and they are retrieved from this repository at install time.

These files provide a great starting point and are good examples of how to write content that HaaS can interact with.

## NOTE

Windows users will have issues with shell files uploaded to minio, from a windows machine, with incorrect line endings. When a linux machine pulls them down, the line endings will be incorrect causing them to fail.
