# HaaS - Sample content

This is sample content you can upload to your minio server, to get started with the HaaS product. When you install HaaS from scratch you will get the option to load these files in automatically, and they are retrieved from this repository at install time.

These files provide a great starting point and are good examples of how to write content that HaaS can interact with.
